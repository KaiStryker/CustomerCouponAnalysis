# Coupon Acceptance Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict coupon acceptance among drivers using data visualization techniques and probability distribution analysis. The data, sourced from the UCI Machine Learning repository and collected via a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk, describes various driving scenarios and coupon types. My goal is to distinguish between customers who accepted a driving coupon and those who did not.

## Data Source
The dataset comprises responses to a survey that asked participants about their likelihood of accepting different types of coupons in various driving scenarios. Answers indicating acceptance are labeled as "Y = 1", and rejections as "Y = 0". The coupons cover categories like less expensive restaurants, coffee houses, carry out and take away, bars, and more expensive restaurants.

## Analysis Summary
- **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Addressed missing values and preprocessed the data to facilitate analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Conducted an initial exploration to understand the dataset's structure and key characteristics.
- **Detailed Coupon Type Analysis**: Focused analysis on specific coupon types, such as bar and coffee house coupons, to understand how different factors influence coupon acceptance.
- **Visualization**: Used various plots to visualize data distributions and relationships between variables.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Employed probability distributions and other statistical methods to glean insights from the data.

## Key Findings
1. **Coffee House Coupons**: Individuals under the age of 30, especially students, are more likely to accept coffee house coupons, with a significant preference for those with longer expiration times. Acceptance rates peak during morning hours for 1-day expiration coupons, aligning with routine coffee runs. Conversely, coupons with a 2-hour expiration see a marked decrease in acceptance, highlighting a customer preference for flexibility.
2. **Bar Coupons**: Drivers over the age of 25 who frequent bars more than once a month exhibit a high likelihood of accepting coupons. This probability increases for those who travel without children and do not work in professions such as farming, fishing, or forestry, suggesting that individuals with higher incomes and fewer familial responsibilities are more inclined to accept these offers.

## Conclusion
My analysis identifies specific demographic groups that are more likely to respond to coupon offers. For coffee house coupons, marketers should focus on younger individuals, particularly students under the age of 30, offering them coupons with longer expiration times to align with their daily routines and preferences for flexibility. In the case of bar coupons, the target demographic includes individuals over the age of 25, who frequent bars more than once a month, and typically do not have children. This group also tends to avoid professions like farming, fishing, or forestry, indicating a higher disposable income. Tailoring marketing strategies to these specific demographic groups with customized offers can significantly enhance coupon redemption rates, making promotions more effective and efficient.
